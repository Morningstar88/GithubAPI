How could the Github API help set up an open source traffic reduction system in Bali?
Question
Bali's traffic can be managed organically and gently, using a network of linked open source version control systems. Github allows for granular project management, and multi-lingual collaboration, without being top-down or rigid.

A grassroots solution implemented in one village could be scaled quickly, using the repo forking feature. Locals would be free to make their own decisions, after a simple, editable template is set up. Once the free trafficflow platform is provided, each village can take the open source project in any direction.

I was thinking of something like:

One Repo per town/village/congestion spot. i.e. /ubud /penestan /campuhan-hairpin-bend. Repos would have a lateral hierarchy, like reddit.

A README per congestion spot, outlining the specific, unique traffic issues, problem and ideas. 5-10 pre-started issues per Repo, where locals and programmers could discuss solutions in multiple languages.

Show a local how to manage a Repo and write GFM. Takes 15 to 30 minutes. Lots of videos already made. Can be done from a smartphone using Githubs well-made app.

Github facilitates open project management. We can trust that each village will make their own decisions. Each regency and village could set clearly signposted speedlimits, painted on wood. Each speed limit sign could be put up for 5-10 USD.

Once a small network is set up, it could be displayed using a front-end site, that displays, issues, a list of current trafficflow repos, new discussions, etc. Many codepens use the github API successfully. Both the front-end and github repo network models can be scaled for free.

Any ideas or questions please go ahead.
